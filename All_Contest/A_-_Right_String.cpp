// For a string T consisting of lowercase English letters, consider the question below, and let

// f(T) be the answer.

//     Find the number of different strings obtained by performing the following operation any number of times: delete the first character from 

//     T and append it to the end. 

// You are given a string
// S of length N consisting of lowercase English letters. You can perform the operation below at most

// K times (possibly zero).

//     Choose a character of 

//     S and change it to any lowercase English letter.

// Find the minimum possible value of
// f(S) after your operations.
