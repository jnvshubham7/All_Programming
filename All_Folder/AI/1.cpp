// 1. Define the 8-puzzle problem.
//8-puzzle problem is a puzzle where the goal is to arrange 
//the tiles in a 3x3 grid in such a way that each tile is in its correct position.    


// 2. List out the possible approaches and explain each algorithm to solve them.
// 1. Brute force:
// Brute force is the simplest approach to solving the problem.
// We can start with an empty grid and try to place each tile in every possible position.
// If we find a solution, we return true.
// If we don’t find a solution, we return false.
// 2. Backtracking:
// Backtracking is an approach to solving the problem that involves recursion.
// We can start with an empty grid and try to place each tile in every possible position.
// If we find a solution, we return true.
// If we don’t find a solution, we backtrack and try to place the next tile in every possible position.
// 3. Dynamic programming:
// Dynamic programming is an approach to solving the problem that involves memoization.
// We can start with an empty grid and try to place each tile in every possible position.
// If we find a solution, we return true.
// If we don’t find a solution, we return false.
// 4. Greedy:
// Greedy is an approach to solving the problem that involves choosing the next tile to place based on some heuristic.
// We can start with an empty grid and try to place each tile in every possible position.
// If we find a solution, we return true.
// If we don’t find a solution, we return false.
// 5. A*:
// A* is an approach to solving the problem that involves choosing the next tile to place based on some heuristic.
// We can start with an empty grid and try to place each tile in every possible position.
// If we find a solution, we return true.
// If we don’t find a solution, we return false.
// 6. Branch and bound:
// Branch and bound is an approach to solving the problem that involves choosing the next tile to place based on some heuristic.
// We can start with an empty grid and try to place each tile in every possible position.
// If we find a solution, we return true.
// If we don’t find a solution, we return false.










// 3. Implement the code of each approach.
