# 1. Define the 8-puzzle problem.
 # 8-puzzle problem is a puzzle where the goal is to arrange the tiles in a 3x3 grid in order.
    # The problem is to find a sequence of moves that will put the tiles in the correct order.
   






# 2. List out the possible approaches and explain each algorithm to solve them.
# The algorithm is to use the A* algorithm to find the shortest path to the goal state.
# The A* algorithm is a graph search algorithm that uses a heuristic function to determine the cost of a path.
# The heuristic function is the cost of the path from the current state to the goal state.



# 3. Implement the code of each approach.


#write code for 8-puzzle problem
