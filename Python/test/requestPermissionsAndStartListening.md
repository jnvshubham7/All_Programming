**Common Permission Request in Android**

**Requesting Phone and SMS Permissions**

Here's an example of how to request phone and SMS permissions in an Android app using the `telephony` package:

```
Future<void> requestPermissionsAndStartListening() async {
    final bool? result = await telephony.requestPhoneAndSmsPermissions;
    if (result == null || !result) {
      logger.e("Permissions not granted");
    }
}
```

**Explanation**

* The `requestPhoneAndSmsPermissions` method is used to request permission to access the phone and SMS functionality on the device.
* The method returns a `bool?` value, which is nullable because the user may choose to not grant the permission.
* In the example code, we use an async/await syntax to wait for the permission request result.
* If the result is `null`, it means the permission request was cancelled, in which case we log an error message. If the result is `false`, it means the user declined the permission, in which case we also log an error message.
* If the result is `true`, it means the user granted the permission, in which case you can proceed with using the phone and SMS functionality.

**Code**

Here is the complete code snippet:
```dart
import 'package:logger/logger.dart';
import 'package:telephony/telephony.dart';

Logger logger = Logger();

Future<void> requestPermissionsAndStartListening() async {
  final bool? result = await telephony.requestPhoneAndSmsPermissions;
  if (result == null || !result) {
    logger.e("Permissions not granted");
  }
}
```

**Example Output**

If the user grants the permission, the output will be:

```
2023-02-20 14:30:00.000 [INFO] Flutter: Permissions granted
```

If the user declines the permission, the output will be:

```
2023-02-20 14:30:00.000 [ERROR] Flutter: Permissions not granted
```
