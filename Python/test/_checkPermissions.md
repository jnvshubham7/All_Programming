**Requesting Android Permissions using Flutter**

### Requesting Multiple Permissions at Once

To request multiple permissions at once in Flutter, you can use the `request()` method provided by the `Permission` class. This method takes a list of permissions as an argument and returns a `Map<Permission, PermissionStatus>` containing the status of each requested permission.

**Code Example**

```dart
Future<bool> _checkPermissions() async {
  Map<Permission, PermissionStatus> statuses = await [
    Permission.sms,
    Permission.phone,
    // Add any other permissions you need here
  ].request();
}
```

**Breaking Down the Code**

*   We use the `Future` keyword to define an asynchronous function `_checkPermissions`.
*   We declare a `Map<Permission, PermissionStatus>` called `statuses` to store the status of each requested permission.
*   We use the `request()` method to request multiple permissions at once. This method takes a list of permissions as an argument and returns a `Map<Permission, PermissionStatus>` containing the status of each requested permission.

### Checking the Status of Requested Permissions

After requesting permissions, you need to check the status of each requested permission. You can use the `values` property of the `statuses` map to retrieve a list of `PermissionStatus` objects, and then use the `every()` method to check if all permissions are granted.

**Code Example**

```dart
bool allGranted = statuses.values.every((status) => status.isGranted);
```

**Breaking Down the Code**

*   We use the `values` property of the `statuses` map to retrieve a list of `PermissionStatus` objects.
*   We use the `every()` method to check if all permissions are granted. This method takes a callback function that returns a boolean value indicating whether the current permission is granted. The `every()` method returns `true` if all permissions are granted, and `false` otherwise.
*   We store the result of the `every()` method in a boolean variable called `allGranted`.

### Handling Denied Permissions

If not all requested permissions are granted, you need to handle the denied permissions. You can do this by calling a function to show a permission dialog, for example.

**Code Example**

```dart
if (!allGranted) {
  _showPermissionDialog();
}
```

**Breaking Down the Code**

*   We use an `if` statement to check if not all requested permissions are granted (i.e., `allGranted` is `false`).
*   If not all requested permissions are granted, we call a function called `_showPermissionDialog` to show a permission dialog.

### Conclusion

Requesting multiple permissions at once in Flutter is a common scenario in building mobile apps. By using the `request()` method and checking the status of each requested permission, you can easily handle permission-related logic in your app.
