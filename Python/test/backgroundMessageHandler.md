**Handling SMS Messages in Flutter: Background Message Handler**

In this article, we'll discuss the concept of handling SMS messages in Flutter, specifically the `backgroundMessageHandler` callback. We'll also provide a brief example of how to implement it.

**What is the `backgroundMessageHandler` callback?**

The `backgroundMessageHandler` callback is a Flutter function that is called when a SMS message is received while your app is in the background. This allows your app to receive and handle SMS messages even when it's not currently running.

**How does it work?**

The `backgroundMessageHandler` callback is part of the `flutter_sms` package, which provides a way to handle SMS messages in your app. When a SMS message is received, the `Android/ iOS` platform sends a notification to your app, which triggers the `backgroundMessageHandler` callback.

**Implementing the `backgroundMessageHandler` callback**

To implement the `backgroundMessageHandler` callback, you need to create a function that matches the `void backgroundMessageHandler(SmsMessage message)` signature. This function will be called whenever a SMS message is received.

Here's an example implementation:
```dart
void backgroundMessageHandler(SmsMessage message) {
  logger.i("Received background SMS: ${message.body}");
  // Handle the SMS message here (e.g., store it in a database)
  // ...
}
```
In this example, the `backgroundMessageHandler` function is called with an `SmsMessage` object as an argument. The `logger` object is used to log a message to the console.

**Example Code**

Here's a complete example of how to implement the `backgroundMessageHandler` callback:
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_sms/flutter_sms.dart';

class SmsExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SmsExampleState createState() => _SmsExampleState();
}

class _SmsExampleState extends State<SmsExample> {
  final _smsPlugin = FlutterSms();

  void backgroundMessageHandler(SmsMessage message) {
    logger.i("Received background SMS: ${message.body}");
    // Handle the SMS message here (e.g., store it in a database)
    // ...
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('SMS Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('This is an SMS example'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _smsPlugin.addEventListener(
      SmsMessageReceivedEvent(),
      (SmsMessage message) => backgroundMessageHandler(message),
    );
  }
}
```
In this example, we create a `SmsExample` widget that uses the `FlutterSms` package to handle SMS messages. We define the `backgroundMessageHandler` function to handle the SMS message when it's received.

**Conclusion**

In this article, we've discussed the concept of handling SMS messages in Flutter using the `backgroundMessageHandler` callback. We've also provided a brief example of how to implement it. By implementing the `backgroundMessageHandler` callback, you can receive and handle SMS messages even when your app is in the background.
