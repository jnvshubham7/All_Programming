Critical section in operating system. You have to explain with examples.

## ASSISTANT
In operating systems, a critical section refers to a portion of code or a segment of a program where shared resources are accessed or manipulated by multiple processes or threads concurrently. It is essential to ensure that only one process or thread can access the critical section at a time to prevent race conditions and maintain data integrity. To achieve this, synchronization mechanisms like mutexes, semaphores, or locks are used.

Let's illustrate the concept of a critical section with a simple example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>

std::mutex mtx; // Mutex for synchronizing access to critical section

int shared_resource = 0;

void increment_shared_resource(int thread_id) {
    // Entry section
    mtx.lock(); // Acquire the lock before entering the critical section
    std::cout << "Thread " << thread_id << " entered the critical section" << std::endl;

    // Critical section
    shared_resource++; // Accessing and modifying the shared resource
    std::cout << "Thread " << thread_id << " incremented the shared resource: " << shared_resource << std::endl;

    // Exit section
    std::cout << "Thread " << thread_id << " exited the critical section" << std::endl;
    mtx.unlock(); // Release the lock after exiting the critical section
}

int main() {
    std::thread t1(increment_shared_resource, 1);
    std::thread t2(increment_shared_resource, 2);

    t1.join();
    t2.join();

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we have a shared resource (`shared_resource`) that is accessed and modified by two threads (`t1` and `t2`) concurrently. The `increment_shared_resource` function represents the critical section. 

1. **Entry Section:** Before entering the critical section, each thread acquires the lock using `mtx.lock()`. If the lock is already held by another thread, the current thread will wait until the lock is released.

2. **Critical Section:** Inside the critical section, threads access and modify the shared resource (`shared_resource`) in a mutually exclusive manner. This ensures that only one thread can perform operations on the shared resource at a time.

3. **Exit Section:** After completing the critical section, each thread releases the lock using `mtx.unlock()`, allowing other threads to enter the critical section.

By synchronizing access to the critical section using mutexes, we ensure that concurrent access to shared resources is controlled and race conditions are avoided, thereby maintaining data consistency and integrity.
