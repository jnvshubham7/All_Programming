Cpp compiler is gcc then what is java compiler


## ASSISTANT
In Java, the primary compiler is `javac`. It is the Java programming language compiler provided by the Java Development Kit (JDK). When you write Java source code files (files with a `.java` extension), you use `javac` to compile them into bytecode files (files with a `.class` extension). The generated bytecode is then executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

For example, you can compile a Java source file named `MyProgram.java` using the following command:

```bash
javac MyProgram.java
```

This command will produce a `MyProgram.class` file containing the bytecode. Subsequently, you can run the program using the `java` command:

```bash
java MyProgram
```

The Java compiler (`javac`) and the Java Virtual Machine (`java`) are essential components of the Java development and execution environment.
