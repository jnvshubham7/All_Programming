## USER
Class and Objects: - A class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. It
encapsulates data and methods that operate on that data. - An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and can have its own unique state and behavior.

## ASSISTANT
Certainly! Let's create a simple example in C++ to illustrate the concepts of class and objects:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// Define a class named 'Car'
class Car {
public:
    // Public members (data and methods)
    std::string brand;
    int year;
    
    // Method to display information about the car
    void displayInfo() {
        std::cout << "Brand: " << brand << ", Year: " << year << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Create an object of the 'Car' class
    Car myCar;

    // Assign values to the object's members
    myCar.brand = "Toyota";
    myCar.year = 2022;

    // Call the method to display information about the car
    myCar.displayInfo();

    // Create another object of the 'Car' class
    Car anotherCar;
    
    // Assign values to the second object's members
    anotherCar.brand = "Honda";
    anotherCar.year = 2021;

    // Call the method to display information about the second car
    anotherCar.displayInfo();

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:
- `Car` is a class that encapsulates data members (`brand` and `year`) and a method (`displayInfo`).
- `myCar` and `anotherCar` are objects of the `Car` class. They are instances with their own unique state.
- Each object has its own set of member variables (`brand` and `year`).
- The `displayInfo` method is called on each object to display information about the cars.

When you run this program, it will output:

```
Brand: Toyota, Year: 2022
Brand: Honda, Year: 2021
```

This demonstrates the basic use of classes and objects in C++.
