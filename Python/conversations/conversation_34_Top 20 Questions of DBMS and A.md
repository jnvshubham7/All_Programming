Top 20 Questions of DBMS and Answers which is asked in Interviews for software engineer job fresher

## ASSISTANT
Certainly! Here are 20 commonly asked DBMS (Database Management System) interview questions for software engineer jobs, along with brief answers:

1. **What is a Database Management System (DBMS)?**
   - **Answer:** DBMS is software that facilitates the creation, organization, and management of databases. It provides an interface for interacting with the database and ensures data integrity, security, and efficient access.

2. **Explain the difference between a DBMS and a RDBMS.**
   - **Answer:** RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) is a type of DBMS that organizes data into tables with relationships, enforcing integrity constraints. All RDBMS are DBMS, but not all DBMS are RDBMS.

3. **What is normalization, and why is it important?**
   - **Answer:** Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to eliminate redundancy and improve data integrity. It reduces data duplication and ensures that data is stored efficiently.

4. **Define ACID properties in the context of database transactions.**
   - **Answer:** ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. It ensures that database transactions are reliable and maintain data integrity in the face of failures.

5. **Explain the difference between a primary key and a foreign key.**
   - **Answer:** A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table, while a foreign key establishes a link between two tables by referencing the primary key of another table.

6. **What is the purpose of the SELECT statement in SQL?**
   - **Answer:** The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. It allows you to specify the columns you want to retrieve and apply conditions for filtering.

7. **Describe the difference between INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN.**
   - **Answer:** INNER JOIN returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables, while OUTER JOIN returns all rows from one table and the matched rows from another.

8. **What is a stored procedure in a database?**
   - **Answer:** A stored procedure is a precompiled collection of one or more SQL statements that can be executed as a single unit. It is stored in the database and can be called multiple times.

9. **Explain the concept of indexing in databases.**
   - **Answer:** Indexing is a technique to optimize the retrieval of data by creating an index on one or more columns. It speeds up query performance but may consume additional disk space.

10. **What is a transaction in the context of a database?**
    - **Answer:** A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL statements that are executed as a single unit. It follows the ACID properties, ensuring consistency and integrity of the database.

11. **Differentiate between clustered and non-clustered indexes.**
    - **Answer:** A clustered index determines the physical order of data in a table, while a non-clustered index does not affect the physical order and creates a separate structure.

12. **What is the purpose of the GROUP BY clause in SQL?**
    - **Answer:** The GROUP BY clause is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns. It is often used with aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.

13. **Explain the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE commands.**
    - **Answer:** DELETE removes rows from a table based on a condition, while TRUNCATE removes all rows from a table without any condition. TRUNCATE is faster but cannot be rolled back.

14. **What is a deadlock in the context of database transactions?**
    - **Answer:** A deadlock occurs when two or more transactions are blocked, each waiting for the other to release a lock. This can result in a situation where no transaction can proceed.

15. **What is a view in a database, and why is it used?**
    - **Answer:** A view is a virtual table based on the result of a SELECT query. It is used to simplify complex queries, restrict access to certain columns, and provide a layer of abstraction.

16. **Explain the concept of data integrity in a database.**
    - **Answer:** Data integrity ensures the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data in a database. It is maintained through constraints like primary keys, foreign keys, and check constraints.

17. **What is the purpose of the HAVING clause in SQL?**
    - **Answer:** The HAVING clause is used with the GROUP BY clause to filter the results of aggregate functions based on a specified condition.

18. **How does an SQL injection attack work, and how can it be prevented?**
    - **Answer:** SQL injection is an attack where malicious SQL statements are inserted into input fields to manipulate a database. It can be prevented by using parameterized queries, input validation, and escaping user input.

19. **What is the role of the COMMIT and ROLLBACK statements in transactions?**
    - **Answer:** COMMIT saves all the changes made during a transaction, while ROLLBACK undoes the changes and restores the database to its previous state.

20. **Explain the difference between a database and a DBMS.**
    - **Answer:** A database is a collection of related data, while a DBMS (Database Management System) is software that manages and facilitates the storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data in a database.

These questions cover a range of topics related to database management systems and are commonly asked in software engineer job interviews.
