Explain virtual function in OOPS.

## ASSISTANT
In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a virtual function is a function declared in a base class that can be overridden by a function with the same signature in a derived class. The concept of virtual functions is central to achieving polymorphism and facilitating dynamic method binding, allowing the selection of the appropriate function to be determined at runtime.

Here are key points related to virtual functions:

1. **Declaration in Base Class:**
   - A virtual function is declared in the base class using the `virtual` keyword. The function in the base class is marked as virtual to indicate that it can be overridden by derived classes.

   ```cpp
   class Base {
   public:
       virtual void myFunction() {
           // Base class implementation
       }
   };
   ```

2. **Overriding in Derived Class:**
   - In a derived class, you can override the virtual function by providing a function with the same signature. The `override` keyword (in C++) is used to explicitly indicate that the function is intended to override a virtual function.

   ```cpp
   class Derived : public Base {
   public:
       void myFunction() override {
           // Derived class implementation
       }
   };
   ```

3. **Polymorphism:**
   - Virtual functions enable polymorphism, where a base class pointer or reference can be used to refer to objects of derived classes. The actual function called is determined at runtime based on the type of the object.

   ```cpp
   Base* myObject = new Derived();
   myObject->myFunction(); // Calls the overridden function in Derived class
   ```

4. **Late Binding (Dynamic Binding):**
   - The process of determining which function to call at runtime is known as late binding or dynamic binding. It allows for flexibility in choosing the appropriate function based on the actual type of the object.

5. **Virtual Destructor:**
   - If a class contains virtual functions, it is good practice to provide a virtual destructor in the base class. This ensures that the destructor of the most derived class is called when deleting an object through a base class pointer.

   ```cpp
   class Base {
   public:
       virtual ~Base() {
           // Virtual destructor implementation
       }
   };
   ```

The use of virtual functions supports the principles of abstraction and polymorphism, allowing for flexible and extensible designs in object-oriented systems. It enables the creation of code that is more easily maintainable and adaptable to changes in requirements.
