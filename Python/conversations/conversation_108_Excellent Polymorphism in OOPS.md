**Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**

**Polymorphism** is one of the fundamental concepts in OOP that allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common base type. It enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types) and is expressed through two main types: compile-time polymorphism (static binding) and runtime polymorphism (dynamic binding).

1. **Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static Binding):**
   - Achieved through method overloading and operator overloading.
   - The decision about which method or operator to call is made at compile time.
   - Known as static binding because the binding between method call and method implementation is resolved during compilation.

   ```java
   class Calculator {
       int add(int a, int b) {
           return a + b;
       }

       double add(double a, double b) {
           return a + b;
       }
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
           int resultInt = calculator.add(5, 10);
           double resultDouble = calculator.add(5.5, 10.5);
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Binding):**
   - Achieved through method overriding and interfaces.
   - The decision about which method to call is made at runtime.
   - Known as dynamic binding because the binding between method call and method implementation is resolved during runtime.

   ```java
   class Animal {
       void makeSound() {
           System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
       }
   }

   class Dog extends Animal {
       @Override
       void makeSound() {
           System.out.println("Dog barks");
       }
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Animal animal = new Dog(); // Upcasting
           animal.makeSound(); // Calls Dog's overridden method at runtime
       }
   }
   ```

**Benefits of Polymorphism:**
- **Code Reusability:** Polymorphism allows the same method name to be used for different types, reducing redundancy.
- **Flexibility:** Enables writing more generic and flexible code that can work with a variety of objects.
- **Simplified Code:** Makes the code more readable and easier to maintain by abstracting common behavior.

Polymorphism is a powerful mechanism that enhances the flexibility and extensibility of object-oriented systems. It encourages the design of code that can adapt to changes and supports a high level of abstraction.
