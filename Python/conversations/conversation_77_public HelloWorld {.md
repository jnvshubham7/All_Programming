It appears that you are trying to create a simple Java program. However, there's a small syntax error in your code. Here's a corrected version:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("shubham");
    }
}
```

Here's a brief explanation:

- The `class` keyword is used to declare a class, and the class name should match the filename (`HelloWorld` in this case).
- The `main` method is the entry point of a Java program and must be declared as `public static void main(String[] args)`.
- `System.out.println("shubham");` prints the string "shubham" to the console.

Remember to save the file with the name `HelloWorld.java` since the filename should match the class name. You can then compile and run the program using the following commands:

```bash
javac HelloWorld.java  // Compile the program
java HelloWorld        // Run the compiled program
```
