explain four pillars of hoops in which you have to explain only abstraction parts, abstraction pillars.

## ASSISTANT
In the context of object-oriented programming (OOP), the four pillars are often considered as:

1. **Encapsulation:** This pillar emphasizes bundling data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit known as a class. Abstraction in encapsulation involves hiding the internal details of how an object's state is stored or implemented and exposing only what is necessary.

2. **Inheritance:** Abstraction in the context of inheritance involves creating a general class (parent or base class) that defines common attributes and behaviors. Subclasses (child classes) can inherit these characteristics and extend or override them to represent more specialized entities.

3. **Polymorphism:** Abstraction in polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their specific class type. This enables flexibility in handling different objects through a common interface, promoting code reuse and extensibility.

4. **Abstraction:** This pillar is specifically about simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors relevant to the application. Abstraction involves creating abstract classes or interfaces that define a common structure without specifying the details of how each class implements that structure.

In summary, abstraction is a crucial aspect across all four pillars of OOP, contributing to the simplification of code and the modeling of real-world entities in a more manageable and understandable way.
