Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, alongside inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. It refers to the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit known as a class. Here's an explanation of the components involved in encapsulation:

1. **Data (Attributes/Fields/Properties):**
   - **Definition:** Data represents the attributes or properties of an object. These are the variables that store information about the object's state.
   - **Example:** In a `Car` class, data could include attributes like `model`, `color`, `speed`, etc.

2. **Methods (Functions/Procedures/Operations):**
   - **Definition:** Methods are functions or procedures associated with the class, defining the behavior of the object. They operate on the data within the class.
   - **Example:** In the same `Car` class, methods could include `startEngine()`, `accelerate()`, `brake()`, etc.

3. **Encapsulation (Combining Data and Methods):**
   - **Definition:** Encapsulation is the concept of bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, i.e., a class. It allows you to control the access to the internal state of an object, providing a protective barrier.
   - **Example:** In the `Car` class, encapsulation ensures that the methods (e.g., `startEngine()`) manipulate the data (e.g., `speed`) in a controlled way. Access to the internal data is typically restricted, and interactions occur through well-defined interfaces.

By encapsulating data and methods within a class, you achieve several benefits:
- **Data Hiding:** The internal state of an object is hidden from the outside world, and access is controlled through methods.
- **Modularity:** Objects can be treated as black boxes, and changes to the internal implementation do not affect external code as long as the interface remains the same.
- **Code Organization:** Encapsulation provides a clean and organized way to structure code by grouping related data and behavior.

In summary, encapsulation combines the data (attributes) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class), providing a way to structure and control access to the internal state of objects in an object-oriented programming paradigm.
