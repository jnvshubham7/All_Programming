this is correct inheritance ???


## ASSISTANT
Yes, your code demonstrates correct inheritance in C++. You have a base class `animal` and a derived class `dog` that publicly inherits from `animal`. Here, `dog` inherits the `eat` function from the `animal` class, and it also has its own member function `bark`. The `main` function creates an instance of `dog` and calls both `eat` and `bark` functions.

So, the output of your program would be:

```
eat
bark
```

This is expected behavior, and your code is a valid example of inheritance in C++.
