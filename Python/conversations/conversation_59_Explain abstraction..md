**Abstraction** is a fundamental concept in computer science and object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors relevant to the problem at hand. It is one of the four major principles of OOP, alongside encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Key points about abstraction:

1. **Focus on Relevant Details:**
   - Abstraction involves focusing on essential characteristics of an object or system while ignoring unnecessary details.
   - It allows developers to model real-world entities as classes with specific attributes and behaviors.

2. **Creation of Abstract Classes and Interfaces:**
   - Abstract classes and interfaces are tools for implementing abstraction.
   - Abstract classes may have abstract methods (methods without a defined implementation) that subclasses must implement.
   - Interfaces define a contract of methods that implementing classes must provide.

3. **Hide Complex Implementation:**
   - Abstraction hides the complex internal details of how a system or object achieves its functionality.
   - Users of an abstracted entity interact with a simplified interface, making it easier to understand and use.

4. **Example in Java:**
   ```java
   // Abstract class
   abstract class Shape {
       // Abstract method
       abstract void draw();

       // Concrete method
       void displayArea() {
           System.out.println("Area is calculated based on shape.");
       }
   }

   // Concrete subclass
   class Circle extends Shape {
       // Implementing abstract method
       @Override
       void draw() {
           System.out.println("Drawing a circle.");
       }
   }
   ```

   In this example, `Shape` is an abstract class that defines an abstract method `draw`. The `Circle` class extends `Shape` and provides a concrete implementation of the `draw` method. Users can work with shapes without needing to know the details of how each shape is drawn.

5. **Simplifies Complex Systems:**
   - Abstraction allows developers to manage complexity by breaking down a system into manageable, abstracted components.
   - It provides a higher-level view that emphasizes what an object does rather than how it achieves it.

Abstraction plays a crucial role in designing modular, maintainable, and scalable software systems. It helps create a bridge between real-world problems and their software solutions by modeling relevant aspects in a clear and understandable way.
