What is package is used in Java?

## ASSISTANT
In Java, a package is a mechanism for organizing and structuring classes and interfaces. It helps in avoiding naming conflicts, grouping related classes, and providing a hierarchical structure to the code. Here are key aspects of packages in Java:

1. **Organizing Code:**
   - Packages provide a way to organize Java classes and interfaces into a hierarchical structure. This hierarchy is reflected in the file system where classes are stored in directories corresponding to their package names.

2. **Naming Convention:**
   - Packages use a naming convention similar to directory paths. For example, if you have a package named `com.example.utilities`, the corresponding directory structure would be `com/example/utilities`.

3. **Preventing Naming Conflicts:**
   - Java packages help prevent naming conflicts between classes. Two classes with the same name can coexist if they belong to different packages.

4. **Access Control:**
   - Packages also play a role in access control. Classes marked with the `default` (package-private) access modifier are only accessible within the same package.

5. **Import Statements:**
   - To use classes from another package, you need to use the `import` statement. This statement allows you to reference classes without using their fully qualified names.

6. **Package Declaration:**
   - At the beginning of each Java source file, you declare the package to which the class belongs. This is done using the `package` statement.

   ```java
   package com.example.utilities;

   public class MyClass {
       // class implementation
   }
   ```

7. **Standard Java Packages:**
   - Java provides a set of standard packages, such as `java.lang`, `java.util`, and `java.io`. These packages contain fundamental classes and utilities that are commonly used in Java programs.

8. **Creating Your Own Packages:**
   - You can create your own packages to organize your code. For example:

   ```java
   // File: MyPackageExample.java
   package com.example.mypackage;

   public class MyPackageExample {
       // class implementation
   }
   ```

9. **Package Hierarchies:**
   - Packages can be organized in a hierarchical manner. For instance, you can have subpackages within a package. For example, `com.example.utilities.sorting`.

   ```java
   package com.example.utilities.sorting;

   public class SortingAlgorithm {
       // class implementation
   }
   ```

Using packages in Java is a best practice for organizing and managing code in larger projects. It promotes modularity, code reusability, and helps maintain a clear structure in your application.
