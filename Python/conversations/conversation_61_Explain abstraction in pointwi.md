As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, I don't have specific information about "abstraction in WinPoint-Wide" or any related term. It's possible that this is a term specific to a certain context, technology, or framework that was introduced or updated after that date.

If "abstraction in WinPoint-Wide" refers to a concept within a particular software, framework, or system, I recommend checking the latest documentation, release notes, or official resources related to WinPoint-Wide for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

If you provide more context or details about what aspect of abstraction you're inquiring about in WinPoint-Wide, I'll do my best to assist based on the information available up to my last update.
