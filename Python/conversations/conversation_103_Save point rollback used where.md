**Savepoints and Rollback in SQL:**

In SQL, a savepoint is a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back. This provides a way to divide a transaction into smaller parts and selectively undo parts of the transaction rather than rolling back the entire transaction. Savepoints are particularly useful in complex transactions where you want to handle errors at a more granular level.

**Syntax to Set a Savepoint:**
```sql
SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;
```

**Syntax to Rollback to a Savepoint:**
```sql
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;
```

**Example:**
```sql
-- Example of using savepoints in a transaction
START TRANSACTION;

-- Some SQL statements

SAVEPOINT sp1;

-- More SQL statements

SAVEPOINT sp2;

-- More SQL statements

-- If an error occurs, you can rollback to a specific savepoint
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT sp1;

-- Continue with the transaction or commit
COMMIT;
```

In this example, two savepoints (`sp1` and `sp2`) are set within a transaction. If an error occurs, you can selectively rollback to a specific savepoint (`sp1` in this case) without rolling back the entire transaction.

Savepoints provide a level of flexibility in handling errors and managing transactions in a more controlled manner. They are commonly used in scenarios where you want to handle errors gracefully without affecting the entire transaction's state.
