Extend the Static Keyboard is used in C++ in Poops concept. Give me examples also for attributes and methods.

## ASSISTANT
It seems like there might be a slight typo in your question ("Poops" instead of "OOPs"). Assuming you are asking about extending a static keyboard class in C++ within the context of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), here's an example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Base class representing a static keyboard
class StaticKeyboard {
public:
    // Attributes
    static const int keyCount = 104;  // Total number of keys

    // Methods
    static void pressKey(int key) {
        std::cout << "Key " << key << " pressed." << std::endl;
    }

    static void releaseKey(int key) {
        std::cout << "Key " << key << " released." << std::endl;
    }
};

// Derived class extending the StaticKeyboard
class ExtendedKeyboard : public StaticKeyboard {
public:
    // Additional attribute
    static const int specialKeyCount = 10;  // Number of special keys

    // Additional method
    static void pressSpecialKey(int specialKey) {
        std::cout << "Special Key " << specialKey << " pressed." << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Using the base class
    StaticKeyboard::pressKey(42);  // Pressing key 42

    // Using the derived class
    ExtendedKeyboard::pressKey(55);         // Pressing key 55 (inherited method)
    ExtendedKeyboard::pressSpecialKey(7);   // Pressing special key 7 (derived method)

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:
- `StaticKeyboard` is the base class representing a static keyboard with attributes (`keyCount`) and methods (`pressKey`, `releaseKey`).
- `ExtendedKeyboard` is a derived class that extends `StaticKeyboard`. It inherits the attributes and methods of the base class and adds its own attribute (`specialKeyCount`) and method (`pressSpecialKey`).
- The `main` function demonstrates the usage of both the base and derived classes.

Keep in mind that using static members for a keyboard representation might be a simplification, and in a real-world scenario, you would likely model keys as objects with dynamic behavior.
