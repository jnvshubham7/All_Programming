## USER
Create a table and list all differences between all fours. Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraction, and Polymorphism.

## ASSISTANT
Certainly! Here's a table summarizing the differences between Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraction, and Polymorphism in the context of Object-Oriented Programming:

| **Aspect**        | **Inheritance**                                                                                                     | **Encapsulation**                                                                                                   | **Abstraction**                                                                                                     | **Polymorphism**                                                                                                            |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**    | Allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class, promoting code reuse and establishing relationships. | Bundling of data and methods into a single unit or class, restricting direct access to components for better control. | Simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on essential properties and behaviors.                         | Objects can be treated as instances of their parent class, but they can take on the form or behavior of their actual class.    |
| **Usage**         | Promotes code reuse, establishes a hierarchy, and supports polymorphism.                                                | Enhances security, hides internal details, and facilitates modularity.                                               | Simplifies understanding by focusing on what an object does rather than how it achieves it.                           | Allows flexibility in working with different types of objects through a common interface.                                      |
| **Implementation** | Achieved through keywords like `extends` (Java), `: (colon)` (Python), or `class` (C++).                               | Implemented by using access modifiers (e.g., private, public) and getter/setter methods.                             | Implemented through abstract classes and interfaces, hiding unnecessary details.                                    | Achieved through method overloading, method overriding, and operator overloading.                                             |
| **Example**        | `class Car extends Vehicle { /*...*/ }`                                                                               | ```java public class Car { private String model; public void start() { /*...*/ } } ```                              | ```java abstract class Shape { abstract void draw(); } class Circle extends Shape { void draw() { /*...*/ } } ```  | ```java void drawShape(Shape s) { s.draw(); } // Can accept Circle, Square, etc. ```                                        |

This table provides a concise overview of the distinctions between Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraction, and Polymorphism in OOP.
