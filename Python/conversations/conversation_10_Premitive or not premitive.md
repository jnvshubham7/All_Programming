Premitive or not premitive

It seems there might be a slight spelling error. I believe you are referring to "primitive" and "non-primitive" in the context of scheduling algorithms. Let me clarify:

- **Primitive (Non-preemptive):** Processes run to completion without interruption. Once a process starts executing, it continues until it finishes or enters a waiting state. Examples include FCFS (First-Come-First-Serve), SJF (Shortest Job Next), Priority Scheduling.

- **Non-primitive (Preemptive):** Processes can be interrupted and temporarily halted, allowing other processes to execute. Preemption can occur based on various criteria, such as time quantum expiration or priority changes. Examples include Round Robin with Time Quantum, Preemptive Priority Scheduling, Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF).

If you have specific scheduling algorithms in mind, feel free to mention them, and I can provide more detailed information.
