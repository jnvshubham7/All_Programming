### Network Topology:

Network topology refers to the physical or logical arrangement of devices in a computer network. Common topologies include:

1. **Bus Topology:** All devices share a single communication line.
2. **Ring Topology:** Devices are connected in a circular fashion.
3. **Star Topology:** All devices are connected to a central hub or switch.
4. **Mesh Topology:** Devices are interconnected, providing multiple paths for data.
5. **Tree Topology:** Combination of star and bus topologies, forming a hierarchical structure.

### Switch, Hub, Router, Bridge:

- **Switch:** Operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model, connecting multiple devices in a local area network and using MAC addresses to forward data to the appropriate device.
  
- **Hub:** A basic networking device that operates at the physical layer (Layer 1), connecting multiple devices in a network. It doesn't filter or manage data; it simply broadcasts data to all connected devices.

- **Router:** Operates at the network layer (Layer 3), connecting different networks and making decisions about where to forward data based on IP addresses.

- **Bridge:** Operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) and connects two or more network segments, making decisions about whether to forward or filter data based on MAC addresses.

### Transmission Modes:

1. **Simplex:** Data can only be transmitted in one direction (e.g., TV broadcasting).
2. **Half-Duplex:** Data can be transmitted in both directions, but not simultaneously (e.g., walkie-talkies).
3. **Full-Duplex:** Data can be transmitted in both directions simultaneously (e.g., telephone conversation).

### IPv4 vs IPv6:

- **IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4):** Uses 32-bit addresses, allowing for approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses. It is the most widely used IP version but faces address exhaustion issues.

- **IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6):** Uses 128-bit addresses, providing an immensely larger address space. IPv6 adoption is increasing to address the limitations of IPv4.

### Subnetting in IP:

Subnetting is the process of dividing a large IP network into smaller sub-networks to improve performance and security. It involves creating subnets with unique network addresses.

### OSI Layer:

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model consists of seven layers, each responsible for specific functions in network communication:

1. **Physical Layer**
2. **Data Link Layer**
3. **Network Layer**
4. **Transport Layer**
5. **Session Layer**
6. **Presentation Layer**
7. **Application Layer**

### TCP/IP Model:

The TCP/IP model, also known as the Internet protocol suite, is a simplified, four-layer architecture used for networking:

1. **Link Layer (Network Interface Layer)**
2. **Internet Layer**
3. **Transport Layer**
4. **Application Layer**

### TCP vs UDP:

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** Provides reliable, connection-oriented communication. It ensures the delivery of data by using acknowledgment and retransmission mechanisms.

- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** Provides connectionless communication without reliability. It is faster than TCP but may result in lost or out-of-order packets.

### DNS, DHCP, FTP, HTTP vs HTTPS, SMTP, SNMP:

- **DNS (Domain Name System):** Resolves domain names to IP addresses.

- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):** Dynamically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network.

- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol):** Used for transferring files between a client and a server.

- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** Used for transferring hypertext requests and information between servers and clients.

- **HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):** Similar to HTTP but adds a layer of security using SSL/TLS encryption.

- **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):** Used for sending emails.

- **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol):** Used for managing and monitoring network devices.

### Flow vs Error Control:

- **Flow Control:** Manages the flow of data between devices to prevent congestion and ensure efficient communication. It prevents fast senders from overwhelming slow receivers.

- **Error Control:** Detects and corrects errors that may occur during data transmission. It ensures the integrity of transmitted data.
