## USER
You have to explain all SQL parts and their types and all queries with the examples you have to write. You have to also write interview questions which is important for me.

## ASSISTANT
Certainly, SQL is a vast topic, and I'll provide a brief overview of its main parts, types, and example queries. I'll also include some interview questions. Note that this is a high-level overview, and each section can be explored in much greater detail.

### SQL Parts:

1. **Data Definition Language (DDL):**
   - **Types:**
     - `CREATE`: Create tables, views, indexes, etc.
     - `ALTER`: Modify existing database structures.
     - `DROP`: Delete tables, views, indexes, etc.
   - **Example:**
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE employees (
         employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
         first_name VARCHAR(50),
         last_name VARCHAR(50),
         salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
     );
     ```

2. **Data Manipulation Language (DML):**
   - **Types:**
     - `SELECT`: Retrieve data from one or more tables.
     - `INSERT`: Insert new records into a table.
     - `UPDATE`: Modify existing records in a table.
     - `DELETE`: Delete records from a table.
   - **Example:**
     ```sql
     SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;
     ```

3. **Data Control Language (DCL):**
   - **Types:**
     - `GRANT`: Provide specific privileges to users.
     - `REVOKE`: Remove specific privileges from users.
   - **Example:**
     ```sql
     GRANT SELECT ON employees TO user1;
     ```

4. **Transaction Control Language (TCL):**
   - **Types:**
     - `COMMIT`: Save changes permanently.
     - `ROLLBACK`: Undo changes made during the current transaction.
   - **Example:**
     ```sql
     COMMIT;
     ```

### SQL Types:

1. **Numeric Types:**
   - `INT`, `FLOAT`, `DECIMAL`, etc.

2. **String Types:**
   - `VARCHAR`, `CHAR`, `TEXT`, etc.

3. **Date and Time Types:**
   - `DATE`, `TIME`, `DATETIME`, etc.

4. **Boolean Type:**
   - `BOOLEAN`.

### SQL Queries:

1. **Basic SELECT:**
   ```sql
   SELECT column1, column2 FROM table WHERE condition;
   ```

2. **JOIN:**
   ```sql
   SELECT employees.first_name, departments.department_name
   FROM employees
   INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
   ```

3. **Aggregation:**
   ```sql
   SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
   FROM employees
   GROUP BY department_id;
   ```

4. **Subquery:**
   ```sql
   SELECT first_name, last_name
   FROM employees
   WHERE department_id IN (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE location = 'New York');
   ```

### Interview Questions:

1. What is the difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN?
2. Explain the purpose of the GROUP BY clause.
3. How can you prevent SQL injection in your queries?
4. Describe the difference between UNION and UNION ALL.
5. What is normalization, and why is it important in databases?
6. Explain the ACID properties in the context of database transactions.
7. When would you use the HAVING clause in a query?
8. Differentiate between primary key and foreign key constraints.
9. What is the purpose of an index in a database?
10. How does the EXISTS operator work in SQL?
