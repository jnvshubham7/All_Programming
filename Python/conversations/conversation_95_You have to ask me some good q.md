You have to ask me some good questions in SQL, and after that I have to answer all questions and you will give me the feedback.

## ASSISTANT
Sure, let's get started! Here are a few SQL questions for you:

1. **Basic Query:**
   - Retrieve all columns from the `Employees` table.

2. **Filtering:**
   - Retrieve the names of employees who work in the "IT" department.

3. **Sorting:**
   - List the employee names in descending order of their IDs.

4. **Aggregation:**
   - Calculate the average salary of employees.

5. **Joining Tables:**
   - Display the names of employees along with their corresponding department names.

Feel free to answer these questions, and I'll provide feedback accordingly!
