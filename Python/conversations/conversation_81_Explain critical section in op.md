Explain critical section in operating system.

## ASSISTANT
In operating systems, a critical section refers to a segment of code or a portion of a program that, when being executed, may access shared resources or variables that are vulnerable to concurrent access by multiple threads or processes. The critical section is crucial because simultaneous execution of multiple threads or processes within this section can lead to data inconsistency or undesirable results.

To ensure the integrity of shared resources, operating systems provide mechanisms for mutual exclusion, allowing only one thread or process to execute the critical section at any given time. Various synchronization mechanisms are employed to achieve mutual exclusion and prevent race conditions. Common synchronization primitives include locks, semaphores, and atomic operations.

### Characteristics of a Critical Section:

1. **Mutual Exclusion:**
   - Only one thread or process can execute the critical section at any moment.

2. **Progress:**
   - If no other thread or process is currently executing in the critical section and some threads or processes wish to enter it, only those not in their remainder section can participate in deciding which will enter.

3. **Bounded Waiting:**
   - There exists a limit on the number of times other processes or threads are allowed to enter the critical section after a process or thread has requested to enter the critical section.

4. **No Assumption of Speed or Number of Processors:**
   - The algorithm should not make any assumptions about the relative speeds of processes or the number of processors.

Ensuring these characteristics helps prevent issues like data corruption, race conditions, and inconsistencies when multiple threads or processes are executing concurrently.

### Example Pseudocode:

```plaintext
EnterCriticalSection()
{
   // Code for entering the critical section
}

ExitCriticalSection()
{
   // Code for exiting the critical section
}

// Usage in a thread or process
while (true) {
    // Code outside critical section

    EnterCriticalSection();
    // Code inside critical section (manipulating shared resources)
    ExitCriticalSection();

    // Code outside critical section
}
```

In the pseudocode, `EnterCriticalSection` and `ExitCriticalSection` represent the mechanisms to enter and exit the critical section, respectively. The critical section contains code that should be executed atomically and is protected from concurrent execution by other threads or processes.
