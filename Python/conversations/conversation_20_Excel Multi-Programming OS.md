Excel Multi-Programming OS

## ASSISTANT
It seems there might be a slight confusion in terminologies. "Multi-programming" typically refers to a mode of operation for computer systems where multiple programs are loaded into memory at the same time and share the CPU through time-sharing. This allows for increased CPU utilization and the concurrent execution of multiple tasks.

On the other hand, Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet program and not an operating system. It runs on top of an operating system, such as Microsoft Windows or macOS.

If you have a specific question or topic in mind related to multi-programming or Excel within the context of an operating system, please provide more details, and I'll do my best to assist you.
