Difference between MAC address and IP address

## ASSISTANT
**MAC Address (Media Access Control Address):**

1. **Layer:**
   - **Location:** Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model.
   - **Function:** Identifies devices within the same local network.

2. **Uniqueness:**
   - **Uniqueness:** Globally unique for each network interface card (NIC) or network adapter.
   - **Assigned by:** The manufacturer of the NIC.

3. **Format:**
   - **Format:** 48 bits (6 bytes) represented in hexadecimal format (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E).

4. **Assignment:**
   - **Static/Dynamic:** Typically static and assigned at the time of manufacturing.
   - **Changeability:** Can be changed, but it's not a common practice.

5. **Scope:**
   - **Scope:** Limited to the local network or broadcast domain.
   - **Routing:** Not used for routing across different networks.

6. **Role in Communication:**
   - **Communication:** Used for communication within the same local network (Layer 2 communication).
   - **Switching:** Essential for Ethernet switches to forward frames to the correct destination.

**IP Address (Internet Protocol Address):**

1. **Layer:**
   - **Location:** Network Layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model.
   - **Function:** Provides a logical address for devices to communicate across different networks.

2. **Uniqueness:**
   - **Uniqueness:** Must be unique within a network but not necessarily globally unique.
   - **Assigned by:** Network administrator or DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server.

3. **Format:**
   - **Format:** 32 bits (IPv4) or 128 bits (IPv6), represented in dotted-decimal (IPv4) or hexadecimal format (IPv6).

4. **Assignment:**
   - **Static/Dynamic:** Can be static (manually configured) or dynamic (assigned by DHCP).
   - **Changeability:** Can be changed as needed.

5. **Scope:**
   - **Scope:** Can be used within a local network or globally on the internet.
   - **Routing:** Essential for routing packets across different networks.

6. **Role in Communication:**
   - **Communication:** Used for end-to-end communication across different networks (Layer 3 communication).
   - **Routing:** Essential for routers to forward packets between different networks.

In summary, MAC addresses are used for local network communication within the same broadcast domain, and they operate at the Data Link Layer. IP addresses, on the other hand, are used for communication across different networks and operate at the Network Layer. Both addresses play distinct roles in the process of network communication.
