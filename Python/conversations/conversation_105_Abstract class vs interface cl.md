Abstract class vs interface class 

## ASSISTANT
**Abstract Class vs. Interface:**

**Abstract Class:**
1. **Definition:**
   - An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and may contain abstract methods (methods without a body).
2. **Instantiation:**
   - Cannot be instantiated directly; it serves as a base class for derived classes.
3. **Abstract Methods:**
   - May contain abstract methods (methods without implementation) that must be implemented by its derived classes.
4. **Access Modifiers:**
   - Can have a mix of abstract and non-abstract methods with various access modifiers.
5. **Fields:**
   - Can have fields (variables) that can be either abstract or non-abstract.
6. **Constructor:**
   - Can have a constructor, which is called when an instance of a derived class is created.
7. **Multiple Inheritance:**
   - Supports single inheritance, meaning a class can only inherit from one abstract class.

**Interface:**
1. **Definition:**
   - An interface is a collection of abstract methods (methods without implementation) and constants.
2. **Instantiation:**
   - Cannot be instantiated directly; its methods are implemented by classes that implement the interface.
3. **Abstract Methods:**
   - Contains only abstract methods, and any class implementing the interface must provide implementations for all of them.
4. **Access Modifiers:**
   - All methods in an interface are implicitly public, and fields are implicitly public, static, and final.
5. **Fields:**
   - Can only have constant fields (public, static, final).
6. **Constructor:**
   - Cannot have a constructor as interfaces are not meant to be instantiated.
7. **Multiple Inheritance:**
   - Supports multiple inheritance, as a class can implement multiple interfaces.

**Usage Scenarios:**
- **Abstract Class:**
  - Used when a common base class needs to be shared among related classes.
  - Suitable for providing a default implementation of some methods in a base class.
- **Interface:**
  - Used when a contract needs to be defined, ensuring that implementing classes adhere to a specific set of methods.
  - Suitable for achieving multiple inheritance-like behavior through interfaces.

In summary, the choice between an abstract class and an interface depends on the design goals and requirements. Abstract classes are suitable for creating a common base, while interfaces are used to define contracts and achieve multiple inheritance in a more flexible manner.
