Explain the difference between C++ and Java in table form.

## ASSISTANT
Certainly! Below is a table highlighting key differences between C++ and Java:

| Feature                     | C++                                   | Java                                      |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Memory Management**        | Manual (Programmer's responsibility)   | Automatic (Garbage Collection)            |
| **Platform Dependency**      | Dependent on the compiler and platform | Platform-independent (Java Virtual Machine)|
| **Compilation/Execution**    | Compiled (generates machine code)      | Compiled to bytecode, interpreted by JVM   |
| **Inheritance**              | Supports single and multiple inheritance| Supports only single-class inheritance, but multiple interface inheritance|
| **Pointers**                 | Supports pointers                     | No explicit pointers (references used)     |
| **Operator Overloading**     | Supports operator overloading         | Does not support operator overloading     |
| **Exception Handling**       | Uses try, catch, throw keywords        | Uses try, catch, throw, and finally keywords|
| **Threading**                | Supports threading with native threads| Supports threading with the Thread class  |
| **Header Files**             | Uses header files (.h) for declarations| No header files; everything is in classes  |
| **Multiple Inheritance**     | Yes                                   | No                                        |
| **Destructor**               | Manually written (e.g., ~ClassName()) | Automatically handled by Garbage Collection|
| **Default Values**           | Supports default parameter values     | No default parameter values in methods    |
| **Access Modifiers**         | Public, private, protected             | Public, private, protected (plus package-private)|
| **Language Design**          | Low-level features for system-level programming| High-level, object-oriented design for ease of use|
| **Memory Model**             | Stack and heap memory management      | Heap memory management via Garbage Collection|
| **Performance**              | Generally faster due to direct memory access and lower-level features| Generally slightly slower due to JVM abstraction and Garbage Collection|

Keep in mind that the choice between C++ and Java depends on the specific requirements of a project, such as performance, platform independence, and development ease.
