## USER
Is default constructor created in compile time or runtime?


## ASSISTANT
The default constructor is created during compile time. It is part of the compilation process where the compiler generates the necessary code for the default constructor based on certain conditions. When you define a class and don't explicitly provide a constructor, the compiler steps in to create a default constructor for you.

This default constructor is then used when objects of the class are instantiated, and it provides default initialization behavior for the members of the class. The process of creating and using the default constructor is part of the compile-time steps before the actual execution of the program.
