Explain how GroupBy has been used. You have to explain with examples, various types of examples, so that I have understood properly.

Certainly! The GROUP BY clause in SQL is used to group rows based on the values in one or more columns. It is typically used in conjunction with aggregate functions to perform operations on each group of rows. Let's go through various examples to understand how GROUP BY works:

### Example 1: Basic GROUP BY
Suppose we have a "Sales" table with columns "Product," "Category," and "Revenue." We want to find the total revenue for each product category.

```sql
SELECT Category, SUM(Revenue) AS TotalRevenue
FROM Sales
GROUP BY Category;
```

This query groups the rows by the "Category" column and calculates the sum of "Revenue" for each category.

### Example 2: GROUP BY with HAVING
Now, let's say we want to find product categories with total revenue greater than $1,000.

```sql
SELECT Category, SUM(Revenue) AS TotalRevenue
FROM Sales
GROUP BY Category
HAVING SUM(Revenue) > 1000;
```

The HAVING clause filters the grouped results based on the specified condition.

### Example 3: GROUP BY with Multiple Columns
If we want to group by multiple columns, such as "Year" and "Month" in addition to "Category," we can do the following:

```sql
SELECT Year, Month, Category, SUM(Revenue) AS TotalRevenue
FROM Sales
GROUP BY Year, Month, Category;
```

This groups the data by both "Year" and "Month" along with "Category."

### Example 4: GROUP BY with Aggregate Functions
Let's find the average and maximum revenue for each product category:

```sql
SELECT Category, AVG(Revenue) AS AvgRevenue, MAX(Revenue) AS MaxRevenue
FROM Sales
GROUP BY Category;
```

Here, we use both AVG() and MAX() aggregate functions within the GROUP BY clause.

### Example 5: GROUP BY with JOIN
Suppose we have a "Products" table and want to find the total revenue for each product category, including product names.

```sql
SELECT p.Category, p.ProductName, SUM(s.Revenue) AS TotalRevenue
FROM Products p
JOIN Sales s ON p.ProductID = s.ProductID
GROUP BY p.Category, p.ProductName;
```

This example demonstrates using GROUP BY in combination with JOIN to fetch additional details from another table.

These examples showcase the flexibility and power of the GROUP BY clause in SQL for aggregating and summarizing data based on specified criteria.
