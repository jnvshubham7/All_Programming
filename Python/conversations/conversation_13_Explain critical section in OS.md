Explain critical section in OS.

## ASSISTANT
In operating systems, a critical section refers to a segment of code within a program where shared resources are accessed or modified. The critical section is crucial because it involves operations that must be executed atomically, meaning without interruption, to avoid data inconsistencies or conflicts between multiple processes or threads.

Key characteristics of a critical section include:

1. **Mutual Exclusion:** Only one process or thread can execute the critical section at a time. This ensures that shared resources are not concurrently accessed, preventing data corruption.

2. **Progress:** If no process is currently executing in its critical section and some processes wish to enter their critical sections, then the selection of the process that will enter next cannot be postponed indefinitely.

3. **Bounded Waiting:** There exists a limit on the number of times that other processes are allowed to enter their critical sections after a process has made a request to enter its critical section and before that request is granted.

To implement the critical section, operating systems often provide synchronization mechanisms such as semaphores, locks, or mutexes. These mechanisms help coordinate access to shared resources and ensure that only one process or thread can enter the critical section at any given time.

Here's a simple example in pseudocode:

```python
# Assume mutex is a binary semaphore or lock

# Process P
while True:
    # Entry section
    wait(mutex)  # Request permission to enter critical section
    
    # Critical section
    # Access shared resources or perform critical operations
    
    # Exit section
    signal(mutex)  # Release the lock to allow other processes to enter

    # Remainder section
    # Perform non-critical operations

# Process Q
while True:
    # Entry section
    wait(mutex)
    
    # Critical section
    # Access shared resources or perform critical operations
    
    # Exit section
    signal(mutex)
    
    # Remainder section
    # Perform non-critical operations
```

In this example, the `mutex` semaphore or lock ensures that only one process can be in its critical section at a time, maintaining mutual exclusion. Processes wait for the `mutex` before entering the critical section and release it when leaving, enforcing the critical section properties.
