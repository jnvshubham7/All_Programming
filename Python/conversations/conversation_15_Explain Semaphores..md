Explain Semaphores.

## ASSISTANT
Semaphores are a synchronization mechanism used in operating systems to control access to shared resources and avoid race conditions among multiple processes or threads. They were introduced by Edsger Dijkstra in the 1960s. Semaphores are typically used to manage critical sections and ensure mutual exclusion.

There are two types of semaphores:

1. **Binary Semaphores:**
   - Also known as mutexes (mutual exclusion), binary semaphores have two states: 0 and 1.
   - They are used for signaling access to a critical section. If the semaphore is 0, it means the critical section is occupied; if 1, it is available.
   - Operations:
     - `wait()` (or `P()`): Decrements the semaphore. If the semaphore is 0, it will block the process or thread until the semaphore becomes 1.
     - `signal()` (or `V()`): Increments the semaphore. If there are waiting processes, one of them is allowed to proceed.

2. **Counting Semaphores:**
   - Counting semaphores can have a value greater than 1.
   - They are used to control access to a pool of resources. The value represents the number of available resources.
   - Operations:
     - `wait()`: Decrements the semaphore. If the semaphore is 0, it will block the process or thread until resources are available.
     - `signal()`: Increments the semaphore. If there are waiting processes, one or more are allowed to proceed.

Here's a simple example in pseudo code using binary semaphores:

```python
# Binary Semaphore (mutex)
mutex = Semaphore(1)

# Process A
wait(mutex)
# Critical Section
# Access shared resources
signal(mutex)

# Process B
wait(mutex)
# Critical Section
# Access shared resources
signal(mutex)
```

In this example, the `wait()` and `signal()` operations ensure that only one process at a time can access the critical section protected by the mutex semaphore. When a process enters the critical section, it executes `wait(mutex)` to acquire the mutex, and when it exits, it executes `signal(mutex)` to release the mutex.

Semaphores are a fundamental building block for designing concurrent and parallel algorithms in operating systems, providing a means to coordinate and synchronize the activities of processes and threads.
