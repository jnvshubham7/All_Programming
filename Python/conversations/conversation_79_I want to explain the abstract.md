## USER
I want to explain the abstraction which is used for hiding the complicity which is not required for showing to users. For example, in ATMs, we only see the money of input, output, and how much money has been raised. And this type of things will see in ATM, but behind the display there will have more complexity and more calculation will happen, which is not seen by ourselves. That is the abstraction. And one more example is like in C++, we have using namespace std. This is whatever the header files will use for hide the complicity. So, this is the true example you have to explain all things.

## ASSISTANT
Certainly! Abstraction in programming is the concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features or functionalities to the users. It allows users to interact with a system or program at a higher level without needing to understand the intricate details of its internal workings.

### Example 1: ATM Operation

In an ATM, users interact with a simple interface to withdraw or deposit money. The ATM abstracts away the complex processes happening behind the scenes, such as communicating with the bank, verifying account details, and handling cash dispensing. Users are shielded from these complexities and are presented with a straightforward set of options.

```plaintext
User Interface:
1. Withdraw
2. Deposit
3. Check Balance
4. Exit
```

Users don't need to know the intricate details of how the ATM communicates with the bank or manages cash; they only interact with the abstraction provided by the user interface.

### Example 2: C++ `using namespace std`

In C++, the `using namespace std` statement is a form of abstraction. The C++ Standard Library provides a vast set of functionalities, including input and output operations, string handling, and more. By including `using namespace std`, you abstract away the details of the Standard Library, allowing you to use its features without specifying the namespace each time.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // No need to specify std:: for cout
    std::cout << "Hello, Abstraction!" << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Here, the `std::` prefix is abstracted away, simplifying the code for better readability. Users can focus on the logic they want to implement without being concerned about the internal details of the Standard Library.

In both examples, abstraction simplifies the user's interaction by providing a clean and understandable interface while hiding the intricate workings happening behind the scenes.
