Certainly! Let's consider another example to demonstrate ambiguity resolution in multiple inheritance:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    void show() {
        cout << "Base class" << endl;
    }
};

class LeftDerived : public Base {
public:
    void display() {
        cout << "Left Derived class" << endl;
    }
};

class RightDerived : public Base {
public:
    void display() {
        cout << "Right Derived class" << endl;
    }
};

class DiamondDerived : public LeftDerived, public RightDerived {
public:
    // Uncomment the following line to see the ambiguity.
    // void show() { cout << "Diamond Derived class" << endl; }
};

int main() {
    DiamondDerived obj;
    obj.LeftDerived::show();    // Accessing show() from LeftDerived
    obj.RightDerived::show();   // Accessing show() from RightDerived
    // Uncomment the following line to see the ambiguity.
    // obj.show();   // Error: Ambiguous call to show()
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we have a diamond-shaped inheritance hierarchy with classes `Base`, `LeftDerived`, `RightDerived`, and `DiamondDerived`. Both `LeftDerived` and `RightDerived` inherit from the `Base` class, and `DiamondDerived` inherits from both `LeftDerived` and `RightDerived`.

If you uncomment the line `// obj.show();`, it will result in a compilation error due to the ambiguity in calling the `show()` function. To resolve the ambiguity, you can use the scope resolution operator to specify which version of the `show()` function to call.

Again, practical solutions may involve avoiding such naming conflicts or considering virtual inheritance based on the specific requirements of your code.
