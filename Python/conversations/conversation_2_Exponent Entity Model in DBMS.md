Exponent Entity Model in DBMS

## ASSISTANT
It seems there might be a confusion in your terminology. In the context of Database Management Systems (DBMS), there isn't a commonly recognized concept called "Exponent Entity Model." However, there is an Entity-Relationship Model (ER Model) which is fundamental in database design.

If you meant something else or if there's a specific aspect of the database or data modeling you're referring to, please provide more details so I can assist you better.
