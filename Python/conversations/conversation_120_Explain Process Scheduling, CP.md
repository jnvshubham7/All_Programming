## ASSISTANT
Certainly! Let's delve into each of these concepts in detail:

1. **Process Scheduling:**
   - **Definition:** Process scheduling is the activity performed by the operating system to manage the allocation of CPU time to processes in a system with multiple processes competing for CPU resources.
   
2. **CPU Scheduler:**
   - **Definition:** The CPU scheduler is a component of the operating system responsible for selecting which process from the ready queue will be executed next by the CPU.
   
3. **Non-Primitive Scheduling:**
   - **Definition:** Non-primitive scheduling involves scheduling based on process characteristics beyond just their arrival time, such as priority, resource requirements, and deadlines.

4. **Primitive Scheduling:**
   - **Definition:** Primitive scheduling involves scheduling based solely on the arrival time of processes, without considering additional factors like priority or resource requirements.

5. **Goals of CPU Scheduling:**
   - **Maximize CPU Utilization:** Keep the CPU busy as much as possible.
   - **Minimize Turnaround Time:** Reduce the total time taken for a process to complete execution.
   - **Minimize Response Time:** Reduce the time taken from submitting a request until the first response is produced.
   - **Fairness:** Provide fair access to CPU resources among processes.
   - **Balanced Throughput:** Achieve a balance between throughput and response time.

6. **Throughput:**
   - **Definition:** Throughput refers to the number of processes completed per unit of time by the CPU.

7. **Arrival Time:**
   - **Definition:** Arrival time is the time at which a process enters the ready queue and is ready for execution.

8. **Burst Time:**
   - **Definition:** Burst time is the amount of CPU time required by a process to complete its execution.

9. **Turnaround Time:**
   - **Definition:** Turnaround time is the total time taken from the submission of a process to its completion, including both waiting time and execution time.

10. **Wait Time:**
    - **Definition:** Wait time is the total time a process spends waiting in the ready queue before it gets executed.

11. **Response Time:**
    - **Definition:** Response time is the time elapsed from submitting a request until the first response is produced.

12. **Completion Time:**
    - **Definition:** Completion time is the time at which a process completes its execution.

13. **FCFS (First Come, First Served):**
    - **Definition:** FCFS is a non-preemptive scheduling algorithm where processes are executed in the order of their arrival in the ready queue. It follows the first-come, first-served principle.

14. **Convoy Effect:**
    - **Definition:** The convoy effect occurs in FCFS scheduling when short processes are stuck behind long processes in the ready queue, resulting in poor CPU utilization and longer waiting times for short processes.

Understanding these concepts is essential for designing efficient CPU scheduling algorithms and managing processes effectively in an operating system.
