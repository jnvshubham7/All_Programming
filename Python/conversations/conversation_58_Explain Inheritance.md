Explain Inheritance

## ASSISTANT
**Inheritance** is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit attributes and behaviors from an existing class (superclass or base class). This mechanism promotes code reuse, extensibility, and the organization of code in a hierarchical structure.

Key points about inheritance:

1. **Base Class (Superclass):**
   - The class whose properties and methods are inherited is called the superclass or base class.
   - It serves as a blueprint for creating new classes.

2. **Derived Class (Subclass):**
   - The class that inherits properties and methods from another class is called the subclass or derived class.
   - It can extend or override the functionality of the superclass.

3. **"is-a" Relationship:**
   - Inheritance models the "is-a" relationship. For example, if you have a `Vehicle` class, you might create subclasses like `Car` and `Motorcycle` since they are types of vehicles.

4. **Code Reusability:**
   - Inherited attributes and methods can be reused in the subclass without duplicating code.
   - This promotes a more modular and maintainable codebase.

5. **Overriding Methods:**
   - Subclasses can provide a specific implementation for a method defined in the superclass. This is known as method overriding.
   - It allows customization of behavior in the subclass.

6. **Access to Superclass Members:**
   - Subclasses typically have access to public and protected members of the superclass.
   - Private members are not directly accessible in the subclass.

7. **Example in Java:**
   ```java
   // Superclass
   class Animal {
       void eat() {
           System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
       }
   }

   // Subclass
   class Dog extends Animal {
       void bark() {
           System.out.println("The dog barks.");
       }

       // Override eat method
       @Override
       void eat() {
           System.out.println("The dog eats bones.");
       }
   }
   ```

In the Java example, the `Dog` class inherits the `eat` method from the `Animal` class and provides its own implementation. This showcases the principle of inheritance in action.
