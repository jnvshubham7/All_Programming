How to represent self-join? You have to give the example.

**Self-Join Representation:**

A self-join is a specific case where a table is joined with itself. This is often used when a table has a hierarchical structure, and you want to compare or relate rows within the same table. To represent a self-join, you need to use aliases to distinguish between the two instances of the same table.

**Example:**
Let's consider a hypothetical table called `Employee` with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(50),
    manager_id INT,  -- This column represents the manager of each employee
    FOREIGN KEY (manager_id) REFERENCES Employee(emp_id)
);

INSERT INTO Employee VALUES
(1, 'John Doe', NULL),  -- John Doe is the top-level manager
(2, 'Alice Smith', 1),  -- Alice Smith reports to John Doe
(3, 'Bob Johnson', 1),  -- Bob Johnson also reports to John Doe
(4, 'Eva Davis', 2),    -- Eva Davis reports to Alice Smith
(5, 'Charlie Brown', 3);  -- Charlie Brown reports to Bob Johnson
```

In this example, the `Employee` table has a foreign key `manager_id` that refers to the `emp_id` within the same table, creating a hierarchy.

**Self-Join Query:**
Now, let's say you want to retrieve a list of employees along with their managers. You can use a self-join for this:

```sql
-- Self-Join Query
SELECT e1.emp_name AS employee_name, e2.emp_name AS manager_name
FROM Employee e1
LEFT JOIN Employee e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.emp_id;
```

**Result:**
```
+---------------+--------------+
| employee_name | manager_name |
+---------------+--------------+
| John Doe      | NULL         |  -- John Doe is the top-level manager
| Alice Smith   | John Doe     |  -- Alice reports to John Doe
| Bob Johnson   | John Doe     |  -- Bob reports to John Doe
| Eva Davis     | Alice Smith  |  -- Eva reports to Alice Smith
| Charlie Brown | Bob Johnson  |  -- Charlie reports to Bob Johnson
+---------------+--------------+
```

In this query, `e1` and `e2` are aliases for two instances of the `Employee` table, allowing you to join the table with itself based on the `manager_id` relationship. The result provides a clear representation of employees and their respective managers.
