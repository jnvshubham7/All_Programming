Cross join vs full join

## ASSISTANT
**Cross Join:**

- **Definition:**
  - Cross join, also known as Cartesian join, returns the Cartesian product of two tables. It combines each row from the first table with every row from the second table, resulting in a large combined set.

- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM table1 CROSS JOIN table2;
  ```

- **Example:**
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM employees CROSS JOIN departments;
  ```

- **Result:**
  - The result will have every combination of rows from `employees` and `departments`.

**Full Join:**

- **Definition:**
  - Full join returns all rows when there is a match in either the left (first) table or the right (second) table. If there is no match, NULL values are filled in for columns from the table without a match.

- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM table1 FULL JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
  ```

- **Example:**
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM employees FULL JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
  ```

- **Result:**
  - The result will have all rows from both tables, matching rows will contain data from both tables, and non-matching rows will have NULL values for columns from the table without a match.

**Comparison:**

- **1. Result Size:**
  - Cross join produces a result set with a size equal to the product of the number of rows in the two tables.
  - Full join produces a result set with a size equal to the sum of the number of rows in the two tables minus common rows.

- **2. NULL Values:**
  - Cross join does not introduce NULL values; it simply combines all possible combinations.
  - Full join introduces NULL values for columns without matches.

- **3. Use Cases:**
  - Cross join is used when you want all possible combinations of rows from two tables.
  - Full join is used when you want all rows from both tables, including unmatched rows.

- **4. Syntax:**
  - Cross join does not involve any condition for matching rows.
  - Full join involves a condition for matching rows.

In summary, cross join generates the Cartesian product of two tables, while full join combines rows from both tables, filling in NULL values for non-matching rows. The choice between them depends on the specific requirements of your query.
