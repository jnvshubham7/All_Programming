**Indexing in Databases:**

Indexing is a database optimization technique used to enhance the speed and efficiency of query processing. It involves creating a data structure (index) that provides a fast and direct access path to the rows in a table based on the values of one or more columns. Instead of scanning the entire table, the database engine can use the index to quickly locate the rows that satisfy the query conditions.

**Types of Indexing:**

1. **Single-Level Index:**
   - **Primary Index:** Created on the primary key of the table. It sorts and stores the entire table based on the primary key.
   - **Secondary Index:** Created on columns other than the primary key. It has a structure separate from the data table.

2. **Multi-Level Index:**
   - **Clustered Index:** Determines the physical order of data rows in the table. The data rows and the index entries are stored together.
   - **Non-Clustered Index:** The data rows and the index entries are stored separately. It contains pointers to the actual data rows.

3. **Composite Index:**
   - Created on multiple columns. It is useful when queries involve conditions on more than one column.

4. **Unique Index:**
   - Ensures that the indexed columns contain unique values. Typically associated with primary keys or columns with unique constraints.

5. **Bitmap Index:**
   - Suitable for columns with a low cardinality (few distinct values). It uses bitmaps to represent the presence or absence of rows for each distinct value.

6. **Covering Index:**
   - Includes all the columns required to satisfy a query, eliminating the need to access the actual table for data retrieval.

7. **Spatial Index:**
   - Used for spatial data types and supports efficient querying of spatial data.

8. **Full-Text Index:**
   - Designed for searching text data efficiently. It enables full-text search capabilities on textual columns.

Indexes speed up data retrieval but come with the cost of additional storage and maintenance overhead. The choice of index type depends on the specific requirements of the queries executed on the database.
