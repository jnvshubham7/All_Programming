You have to write the top 20 questions of SQL with the answers in detail.

## ASSISTANT
Certainly! Here are 20 SQL questions along with their answers:

### 1. What is SQL?
**Answer:** SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It allows users to define, query, and manipulate data in a database.

### 2. Explain the difference between SQL and MySQL.
**Answer:** SQL is a language used to manage and query relational databases, while MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses SQL as its query language.

### 3. What is a primary key?
**Answer:** A primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a table. It ensures that each row in a table can be uniquely identified and is used to enforce entity integrity.

### 4. Differentiate between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN.
**Answer:** INNER JOIN returns only the matching rows from both tables, while LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.

### 5. Explain the purpose of the GROUP BY clause.
**Answer:** The GROUP BY clause is used to group rows based on the values in one or more columns. It is often used with aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, AVG) to perform operations on each group of rows.

### 6. How can you prevent SQL injection in your queries?
**Answer:** To prevent SQL injection, use parameterized queries or prepared statements. These mechanisms ensure that user input is treated as data, not executable code.

### 7. What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL?
**Answer:** UNION combines and returns distinct rows from two or more SELECT statements, while UNION ALL combines all rows, including duplicates.

### 8. Explain the purpose of the HAVING clause.
**Answer:** The HAVING clause filters the results of a GROUP BY query based on a specified condition. It is similar to the WHERE clause but operates on aggregated data.

### 9. What is normalization, and why is it important?
**Answer:** Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and dependency. It helps in eliminating data anomalies and ensures efficient data storage and retrieval.

### 10. Describe the ACID properties in the context of database transactions.
**Answer:** ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. These properties ensure that database transactions are reliable and maintain data integrity.

### 11. What is a foreign key?
**Answer:** A foreign key is a field in a table that refers to the primary key in another table. It establishes a link between the two tables, enforcing referential integrity.

### 12. How does the EXISTS operator work in SQL?
**Answer:** The EXISTS operator is used to check whether a subquery returns any rows. If the subquery returns at least one row, the EXISTS condition is true.

### 13. Explain the purpose of the INDEX in a database.
**Answer:** An INDEX in a database is used to speed up the retrieval of rows from a table. It enhances the search performance by creating a data structure that allows quick access to rows.

### 14. Differentiate between CHAR and VARCHAR data types.
**Answer:** CHAR is a fixed-length string data type, while VARCHAR is a variable-length string data type. CHAR pads the stored data with spaces to the defined length, while VARCHAR only stores the actual data.

### 15. What is a view in SQL?
**Answer:** A view is a virtual table created by a query. It does not store the data itself but provides a way to present the results of a SELECT statement as if it were a table.

### 16. Explain the purpose of the TRUNCATE statement.
**Answer:** The TRUNCATE statement is used to quickly delete all rows from a table. It is more efficient than the DELETE statement for removing all records from a table.

### 17. How do you handle NULL values in SQL?
**Answer:** NULL represents an unknown or missing value. To handle NULL values, use the IS NULL or IS NOT NULL conditions in WHERE clauses, and consider using the COALESCE or IFNULL functions.

### 18. What is a stored procedure?
**Answer:** A stored procedure is a precompiled collection of one or more SQL statements. It is stored in the database and can be executed with a single call, often improving performance and security.

### 19. Explain the purpose of the ORDER BY clause.
**Answer:** The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set of a query in ascending or descending order based on one or more columns.

### 20. What is a self-join?
**Answer:** A self-join occurs when a table is joined with itself. It is useful when querying hierarchical or nested data stored in the same table.
