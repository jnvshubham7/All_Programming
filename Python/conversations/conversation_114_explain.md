Certainly! Let's break down the code and its concepts:

1. **Classes:**
   - `Student`: Represents a student with a roll number.
   - `Exam`: Inherits from `Student` and adds functionality for storing marks in mathematics and physics.
   - `Sports`: Represents the sports aspect and includes a score.
   - `Result`: Inherits from both `Exam` and `Sports`, combining academic and sports-related information.

2. **Inheritance:**
   - `Exam` and `Sports` both inherit from `Student`, creating a chain of inheritance.
   - `Result` inherits from both `Exam` and `Sports`, showcasing multiple inheritance.

3. **Data Members:**
   - `roll_number`, `maths`, `physics`, and `score` are data members representing different attributes.

4. **Methods:**
   - `set_roll_number`, `get_roll_number`, `set_marks`, `get_marks`, `set_score`, `get_score`: These are setter and getter methods to manipulate and retrieve the values of data members.

5. **Main Function:**
   - An instance of the `Result` class (`harry`) is created.
   - Roll number, marks, and sports score are set using setter methods.
   - The `display_results` method is called to display the overall result, including the average of marks and the sports score.

6. **Output:**
   - The program displays the roll number, marks in mathematics and physics, sports score, and the overall result percentage.

This code is an example of how multiple inheritance can be used in C++ to model different aspects of an entity. The `Result` class inherits attributes and behaviors from both academic and sports-related classes, showcasing the flexibility of object-oriented programming.
