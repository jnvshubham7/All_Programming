## USER
Static (Variables, Functions, Objects): - Static variables: Belong to the class rather than instances (objects) of the class. They retain
their values throughout the program and are accessed using the class name. - Static functions: Belong to the class and can be called without creating an object. They can
only access other static members. - Static objects: Objects that are created and destroyed only once, usually used to hold common data shared among all instances of a class.


## ASSISTANT
Certainly! Let's elaborate on static variables, static functions, and static objects in C++:

### Static Variables:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class MyClass {
public:
    // Static variable belongs to the class
    static int staticVar;
};

// Initialization of the static variable
int MyClass::staticVar = 10;

int main() {
    // Accessing the static variable using the class name
    std::cout << "Static Variable: " << MyClass::staticVar << std::endl;

    // Modifying the static variable using the class name
    MyClass::staticVar = 20;

    std::cout << "Modified Static Variable: " << MyClass::staticVar << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Here, `staticVar` is a static variable belonging to the class `MyClass`. It is accessed and modified using the class name.

### Static Functions:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class MyClass {
public:
    // Static function can be called without creating an object
    static void staticFunction() {
        std::cout << "Static Function Called" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Calling the static function without creating an object
    MyClass::staticFunction();

    return 0;
}
```

The `staticFunction` is a static function belonging to the class `MyClass`. It can be called without creating an object of the class.

### Static Objects:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Singleton {
private:
    // Private constructor to prevent object creation
    Singleton() {}

public:
    // Static method to get the single instance of the class
    static Singleton& getInstance() {
        static Singleton instance;
        return instance;
    }

    void showMessage() {
        std::cout << "Hello from Singleton!" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Accessing the static object using the static method
    Singleton& myInstance = Singleton::getInstance();
    myInstance.showMessage();

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `Singleton` is a class with a private constructor, and a static method `getInstance` is used to access a single instance of the class. The instance is a static object that is created and destroyed only once.
