## USER
You have to give a big example of each query.

## ASSISTANT
Certainly! Let's go through more comprehensive examples for each type of SQL query.

### 1. **SELECT Statement:**

#### Example:
Assume we have a table named `Students` with columns `StudentID`, `FirstName`, `LastName`, and `Age`. To retrieve all students:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Students;
```

### 2. **WHERE Clause:**

#### Example:
Retrieve students older than 20:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Students WHERE Age > 20;
```

### 3. **ORDER BY Clause:**

#### Example:
Retrieve students sorted by age in descending order:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Students ORDER BY Age DESC;
```

### 4. **INSERT INTO Statement:**

#### Example:
Insert a new student:

```sql
INSERT INTO Students (FirstName, LastName, Age) VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 22);
```

### 5. **UPDATE Statement:**

#### Example:
Update the age of a student:

```sql
UPDATE Students SET Age = 23 WHERE StudentID = 101;
```

### 6. **DELETE Statement:**

#### Example:
Delete a student:

```sql
DELETE FROM Students WHERE StudentID = 102;
```

### 7. **GROUP BY Clause:**

#### Example:
Count the number of students in each age group:

```sql
SELECT Age, COUNT(StudentID) FROM Students GROUP BY Age;
```

### 8. **HAVING Clause:**

#### Example:
Retrieve age groups with more than two students:

```sql
SELECT Age, COUNT(StudentID) FROM Students GROUP BY Age HAVING COUNT(StudentID) > 2;
```

### 9. **JOIN Clause:**

#### Example:
Assume we have two tables, `Orders` and `Customers`. Retrieve order details with customer names:

```sql
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Orders.OrderDate, Customers.CustomerName
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
```

### 10. **UNION Operator:**

#### Example:
Assume we have two tables, `Electronics` and `Appliances`, both with a `ProductName` column. Combine unique product names:

```sql
SELECT ProductName FROM Electronics
UNION
SELECT ProductName FROM Appliances;
```

### 11. **CREATE TABLE Statement:**

#### Example:
Create a new table named `Books`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Books (
    BookID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Title VARCHAR(100),
    Author VARCHAR(50),
    PublishedYear INT
);
```

### 12. **ALTER TABLE Statement:**

#### Example:
Add a new column `Genre` to the `Books` table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Books
ADD Genre VARCHAR(50);
```

### 13. **DROP TABLE Statement:**

#### Example:
Drop the table named `Movies`:

```sql
DROP TABLE Movies;
```

These examples cover a wide range of scenarios, and you can adapt them to your specific use case. SQL queries are often used in context with a database schema and data, so the actual structure and content of your database will influence the queries you write. Feel free to ask for more detailed examples or explanations based on specific aspects of SQL.
