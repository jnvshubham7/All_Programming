**Implementing Alert Dialogs in Flutter**

 Alert dialog is a type of modal window that appears on top of the current screen to inform the user about something, typically providing some information or asking for feedback. In Flutter, you can create an alert dialog using the `showDialog` method and a `AlertDialog` widget.

**Concepts:**

* `showDialog`: A method that displays a modal route, such as a dialog, on top of the current screen.
* `AlertDialog`: A widget that creates an alert dialog, which is a type of modal window.

**Example:**

In the following example, we create an alert dialog that displays a title and a message to the user. The dialog has an "OK" button that dismisses the dialog when pressed.
```dart
void _showAlertDialog(String title, String message) {
  logger.d("Showing alert dialog - $title: $message");
  showDialog(
    context: context, // The context in which the dialog will be displayed
    builder: (BuildContext context) {
      return AlertDialog(
        title: Text(title), // The title of the dialog
        content: Text(message), // The message to be displayed
        actions: [
          ElevatedButton(
            child: const Text('OK'), // The text to be displayed on the button
            onPressed: () {
              logger.d("Alert dialog dismissed");
              Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Dismiss the dialog
            }
          ),
        ],
      );
    },
  );
}
```
**Explanation:**

1. The `_showAlertDialog` method takes two arguments: `title` and `message`. These will be displayed in the alert dialog.
2. The `showDialog` method is called with the current context and a builder function that returns the alert dialog widget.
3. The `AlertDialog` widget is created with a `title` and `content` property. The `title` property is set to a `Text` widget that displays the `title` argument. The `content` property is set to a `Text` widget that displays the `message` argument.
4. The `actions` property of the `AlertDialog` widget is set to a list of widgets. In this case, the list contains a single `ElevatedButton` widget.
5. The `onPressed` property of the `ElevatedButton` widget is set to a callback function that will be executed when the button is pressed. In this case, the callback function simply logs a message to the console and dismisses the dialog using `Navigator.of(context).pop()`.
