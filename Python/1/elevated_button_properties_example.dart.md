**Understandig the `ElevatedButton` widget and its properties in Flutter**

In Flutter, the `ElevatedButton` widget is a basic button component that can be used to perform various actions. In this article, we will explore the `ElevatedButton` widget and its properties, along with a detailed explanation and example code.

**What is the `ElevatedButton` widget?**

The `ElevatedButton` widget is a material design button that raises up the button when pressed. It is used to trigger an action or perform a specific task. This widget is part of the `material` library in Flutter and is designed to conform to the Material Design guidelines.

**Properties of the `ElevatedButton` widget**

The `ElevatedButton` widget has several properties that can be used to customize its behavior and appearance. Some of the most commonly used properties are:

* `child`: This property is used to specify the widget that will be displayed as the button's child. In our example, we are using a `Text` widget with the text "OK".
* `onPressed`: This property is used to specify the callback function that will be executed when the button is pressed.

**Example Code**

Here is an example code snippet that uses the `ElevatedButton` widget:
```dart
ElevatedButton(
  child: const Text('OK'),
  onPressed: () {
    Navigator.of(context).pop();
  },
)
```
**Explanation**

In this example, we are creating an `ElevatedButton` widget with the text "OK" as its child. The `onPressed` property is set to a callback function that will be executed when the button is pressed. This function uses the `Navigator` class to pop the current route from the navigator.

**How the `ElevatedButton` widget works**

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the `ElevatedButton` widget works:

1. When the button is pressed, the `onPressed` callback function is executed.
2. The `onPressed` function is responsible for performing the desired action. In our example, this action is to pop the current route from the navigator.
3. The `Navigator` class is used to manage the navigation process in a Flutter app. It provides a way to navigate between different routes or screens.
4. When the button is pressed, the `Navigator` class pops the current route from the navigator, which causes the screen to change to the previous route.

**Conclusion**

In this article, we have explored the `ElevatedButton` widget and its properties in Flutter. We have also seen an example code snippet that uses the `ElevatedButton` widget to pop the current route from the navigator when pressed. Understanding the `ElevatedButton` widget and its properties is essential for building robust and user-friendly interfaces in Flutter.
