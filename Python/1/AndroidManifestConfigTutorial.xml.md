**Android App Configuration: Understanding the AndroidManifest.xml File**

**Understanding the AndroidManifest.xml File**

The AndroidManifest.xml file is a critical file in an Android app's project structure, used to declare components such as activities, services, and receivers. It is also used to declare permissions, features, and other aspects of the app.

**Common Issues and Solutions**

### Issue 1: Warning about Deprecation

* **Error Message:** "The Android runtime couldn't find the MainActivity class during the launch of your application."
* **Solution:** Review the specific API calls mentioned in the warning message and look for alternative non-deprecated methods or classes that achieve the same functionality.

### Issue 2: ClassNotFoundException

* **Error Message:** "The Android runtime couldn't find the MainActivity class during the launch of your application."
* **Solution:**
  * Verify Package Names: Ensure that the package name specified in the AndroidManifest.xml file matches the package name of your MainActivity class.
  * Check Class Name and File Location: Verify that the `MainActivity.java` file is located in the correct directory within your project structure.
  * Clean and Rebuild Project: Clean and rebuild your project in Android Studio to regenerate all necessary files.
  * Check for Typos: Make sure there are no typos or misspellings in the class name specified in the `<activity>` tag.
  * Inspect Logcat Output: Review the Logcat output for any additional error messages or stack traces that might provide more context about the issue.

### Issue 3: Requesting Permissions

* **Code Snippet:** 

```java
if (ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(this, Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE) != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
ActivityCompat.requestPermissions(this, new String[]{Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE}, 2);
Toast.makeText(this, "Please grant permission to save location", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
}
```


* **Explanation:** This code checks if the app has the permission to write to external storage. If the permission is not granted, it requests the permission from the user and displays a toast message asking the user to grant permission to save the location.

**Code:**

```xml

<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourpackagename">
    <!-- Activities, services, receivers, etc. -->
    <application
        android:roundIcon="@mipmap/ic_launcher_round"
        android:supportsRtl="true"
        android:theme="@style/AppTheme">
    </application>
</manifest>

```

**Java Code:**

```java
package com.shubham.groundtruthcollection;

import android.Manifest;
import android.app.Activity;
import android.content.Context;
import android.content.DialogInterface;
import android.content.Intent;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.view.View;
import android.widget.Button;
import android.widget.Toast;

import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;

import pub.devrel.easypermissions.EasyPermissions;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity implements EasyPermissions.PermissionCallbacks {

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        // Request permissions
        if (EasyPermissions.hasPermissions(this, Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE)) {
            // Permission has been granted
        } else {
            // Request permission
            EasyPermissions.requestPermissions(this, "Permission required to save location",
                    123, Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onRequestPermissionsResult(int requestCode, String[] permissions, int[] grantResults) {
        super.onRequestPermissionsResult(requestCode, permissions, grantResults);
        if (grantResults.length > 0 && grantResults[0] == PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
            // Permission has been granted
        }
    }
}
```
