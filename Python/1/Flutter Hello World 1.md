**Building a Simple Flutter Application**

**Objective**: Display "Hello, World!" in a Flutter application.

### Code Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Hello, World!'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Hello, World!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Key Differences Between Java, Android, and Flutter

1. **Language**:
   - **Java**: A general-purpose programming language used for a variety of applications including web, desktop, and Android development.
   - **Flutter**: Utilizes Dart, a programming language optimized for building UIs.

2. **Platform**:
   - **Java**: Used for various types of applications, not limited to mobile.
   - **Android**: Specifically targets Android mobile devices, utilizing Java or Kotlin.
   - **Flutter**: Facilitates cross-platform development, allowing for apps to be built for Android, iOS, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

3. **Development Tools**:
   - **Java**: Typically developed using IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
   - **Android**: Developed with Android Studio, which provides specialized tools and features for Android.
   - **Flutter**: Can be developed using Android Studio, Visual Studio Code, or other IDEs that support Dart and Flutter plugins.

4. **UI Framework**:
   - **Java**: Does not include a native UI framework; relies on external frameworks like JavaFX or Swing for desktop apps.
   - **Android**: Uses a native UI toolkit designed for Android devices.
   - **Flutter**: Utilizes a custom set of widgets and a Skia graphics engine for rendering UI components.

5. **Performance**:
   - **Java**: Native Android apps might achieve better performance on Android devices due to native code execution.
   - **Flutter**: Offers near-native performance through its efficient rendering engine and Dart's ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation.

### Conclusion

Each technology serves a distinct purpose:
- **Java**: Versatile for various applications.
- **Android**: Specialized for mobile app development on Android.
- **Flutter**: Provides a modern approach to cross-platform app development with a focus on a rich UI and high performance.
