**Exception Handling in Java: ApiException and Lambda Expressions**

**Introduction**

In this article, we will discuss two important concepts in Java: `ApiException` and lambda expressions. `ApiException` is a specific exception class used in Google Sign-In integration to handle errors that can occur during the sign-in process. Lambda expressions provide a concise way to represent functional interfaces in Java. We will explore these concepts in detail with code examples.

**ApiException**

When integrating Google Sign-In in your Java application, you may encounter errors during the sign-in process. The `ApiException` class is used to handle these errors. It is an exception that can be thrown by the `getResult()` method of the `Auth.getApiException()` method.

Here is an example of how to use `ApiException`:
```java
try {
    Task<ApiException> task = auth.getApiException();
    ApiException exception = task.getResult(ApiException.class);
    // Handle the error
} catch (ApiException e) {
    // Handle the exception
}
```
In this example, the `getResult()` method of the `task` object is used to get the result of the operation. The `ApiException` class is specified as the expected type of the result. If the result is not of type `ApiException`, an exception will be thrown.

**Lambda Expressions**

Lambda expressions provide a concise way to represent functional interfaces in Java. A functional interface is an interface that has only one abstract method. Lambda expressions allow you to create instances of these functional interfaces without the need for implementing a separate class.

The syntax for a lambda expression in Java is as follows:
```java
(parameters) -> { body }
```
Here, the parameters represent the input arguments for the method, and the body contains the code that is executed when the lambda expression is invoked.

Here is an example of how to use lambda expressions:
```java
List<Integer> numbers = List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);

// Using lambda expression
List<Integer> evenNumbers = numbers.stream()
        .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());

System.out.println("Even numbers: " + evenNumbers);
```
In this example, a lambda expression is used to filter out the even numbers from a list of integers. The `filter()` method takes a lambda expression as an argument, which is used to determine whether an element should be included in the resulting list.

**Conclusion**

In this article, we have discussed the `ApiException` class and lambda expressions in Java. `ApiException` is a specific exception class used in Google Sign-In integration to handle errors that can occur during the sign-in process. Lambda expressions provide a concise way to represent functional interfaces in Java. We have also provided code examples to illustrate these concepts.
