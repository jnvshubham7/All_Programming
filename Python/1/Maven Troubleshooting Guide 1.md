### **Troubleshooting Maven Issues**

### **Check Maven Repository Status**

Sometimes Maven Central repository may experience downtime or issues. You can check the status of Maven Central at https://status.maven.org/.

### **Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Guide**

If you have tried the above steps and still encounter issues, you may need to investigate further or seek assistance from your network administrator or Maven support channels.

**Code Examples**

``` xml
<!-- Updated pom.xml file with version 2.7.0 for the spring-boot-starter-parent -->
<parent>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>2.7.0</version>
</parent>
```

### **Troubleshooting Steps**

Here are a few steps you can try to resolve this issue:

#### **Check Network Connection**

Ensure that your internet connection is stable and that you can access the Maven Central repository (`https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/`) and Spring repositories (`https://repo.spring.io/milestone`).

#### **Clear Maven Cache**

Sometimes, cached artifacts can cause issues. Try clearing the Maven local repository cache. You can do this by deleting the contents of the `.m2/repository` directory in your user home directory.

#### **Update Maven Settings**

Check if your Maven `settings.xml` file is correctly configured. Ensure that there are no proxy settings blocking access to repositories.

#### **Force Update**

You can force Maven to update snapshots and dependencies by using the `-U` flag. Try running `mvn clean install -U` to force update dependencies.

#### **Repository Availability**

Ensure that the Spring repositories (`https://repo.spring.io/milestone`) are available and accessible from your network. Sometimes, repository servers may be down or experiencing issues.

**Comparison of Java, Android, and Flutter**

Here is a comparison between Java, Android, and Flutter along with examples to illustrate the differences:

### **Java**

Overview:

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language. It's platform-independent due to its JVM (Java Virtual Machine). Primarily used for server-side applications, desktop applications, and Android app development.

Example:
A simple Java program to print "Hello, World!":

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

### **Android**

Overview:

Android is an operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open-source software. It is designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Android applications are often written in Java or Kotlin using the Android SDK.

Example:
A simple Android activity written in Java that displays "Hello, World!".

```java
package com.example.helloworld;

import android.os.Bundle;
import android.widget.TextView;
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        TextView textView = new TextView(this);
        textView.setText("Hello, World!");
        setContentView(textView);
    }
}
```

### **Flutter**

Overview:

Flutter is an open-source UI software development toolkit created by Google. It is used to develop cross-platform applications from a single codebase for Android, iOS, web, and desktop. Flutter uses Dart as its programming language.

Example:
A simple Flutter application that displays "Hello, World!".

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Hello, World!'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Hello, World!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
