**Requesting Permissions and Handling Results in Flutter**

In Flutter, when we need to access sensitive functionality like phone or SMS permissions, we need to request permission from the user. This is a standard practice in Android and iOS app development. In this article, we will explore how to request permissions and handle the results in Flutter.

**The Concept**

In Flutter, we use the `permission_handler` package to request permissions. This package provides a simple way to request and handle permissions on both Android and iOS platforms. The `requestPhoneAndSmsPermissions` method is used to request permission to access phone and SMS functionality.

**Example Code**

Let's take a look at the example code:
```dart
Future<void> requestPermissionsAndStartListening() async {
  final bool? result = await telephony.requestPhoneAndSmsPermissions;
  if (result == null || !result) {
    logger.e("Permissions not granted");
  }
}
```
In this code, we define a method `requestPermissionsAndStartListening()` that asynchronously requests permission to access phone and SMS functionality using the `telephony` object from the `permission_handler` package. The `requestPhoneAndSmsPermissions` method returns a `Future` that resolves to a boolean value indicating whether the permission was granted or not.

**Explanation**

Here's what's happening in the code:

1. We define the method `requestPermissionsAndStartListening()` that will request permission to access phone and SMS functionality.
2. We use the `await` keyword to wait for the result of the `requestPhoneAndSmsPermissions` method, which returns a `Future` that resolves to a boolean value.
3. We check if the result is null or false, which means the permission was not granted. In this case, we log an error message using the `logger` object.
4. If the result is true, it means the permission was granted, and we can proceed with using the phone and SMS functionality.

**Handling Permission Results**

When the user grants or denies permission, the `requestPhoneAndSmsPermissions` method returns a boolean value indicating the result. We can use this value to handle the permission result.

For example, if we want to perform an action only if the permission is granted, we can do so by using the result of the `requestPhoneAndSmsPermissions` method:
```dart
Future<void> requestPermissionsAndStartListening() async {
  final bool? result = await telephony.requestPhoneAndSmsPermissions;
  if (result == true) {
    // Permission granted, proceed with using phone and SMS functionality
  } else {
    // Permission not granted, handle the error
  }
}
```
In this example, we check if the result is true, and if so, we proceed with using the phone and SMS functionality. If the result is false, we handle the error.

**Conclusion**

In this article, we explored how to request permissions and handle the results in Flutter using the `permission_handler` package. We learned how to request permission to access phone and SMS functionality and how to handle the result of the permission request. By following these steps, you can ensure that your Flutter app handles permission requests correctly and provides a smooth user experience.
