vector<int> solution(int n, int k, vector<vector<int>> events) {

//     A farmer John has a piece of land divided into n sequential patches numbered from 0 to n - 1. Initially, no patch has a crop in it. He wants to grow different kinds of crops in these patches. He also has a sprinkler to water the crops, but it is faulty and sprinkles water at different intensities each time it is used.
// John sequentially carries out k events of one of the two types:

// He grows a crop which has a water-withstanding capacity c in patch i (if that patch already had a crop, it is removed to grow this new one)
// He starts the sprinkler for the patches in the range from l to r - 1 which sprinkles water at an intensity w. Due to this, all the crops in the patches l to r - 1 whose water-withstanding capacity is not more than w (c \leqâ‰¤ w) get damaged and John needs to remove them.
// Note: The water-withstanding capacity c of a crop having (c \gt> w) does not decrease after a sprinkling event.
// You have to find out how many crops are damaged after each sprinkling event.
